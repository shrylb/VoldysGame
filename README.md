## 💡 Inspiration
As a Potterhead, I wanted to bring together my love for coding and the Wizarding World, so I built this, back in 2021, at the 2nd year of my four-year course at UP for practice and fun.
By 2024, I remembered to put it on Git, and remembered to deploy it by September 2025 HAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAH
